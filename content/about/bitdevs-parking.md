### Parking Advice

Here is the address of most of our meetups.

[Dick's Primal Burger](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=4905+SE+Woodstock+Blvd,+Portland,+OR)

Parking is free in this area.   If there are no spaces on the main boulevard, you can park off to the side in one of the residential streets.

FYI:  If you don't like "primal burgers", there is a very large food cart pod very close by to the West of Primal Burger.

#### How to find us

The Private Event Space is to the right from the ordering counter when facing it, after you walk in the door from Woodstock Blvd.

Do not fear if nobody shows up between 6:30pm - 7pm, as sometimes we show up late.
